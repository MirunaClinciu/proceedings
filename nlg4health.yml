- abstract: Natural Language Generation has been proved to be effective and efficient
    in constructing health behaviour change support systems. We are working on DrivingBeacon,
    a behaviour change support system that uses telematics data from mobile phone
    sensors to generate weekly data-to-text feedback reports to vehicle drivers. The
    system makes use of a wealth of information such as mobile phone use while driving,
    geo-information, speeding, rush hour driving to generate the feedback. We present
    results from a real-world evaluation where 8 drivers in UK used DrivingBeacon
    for 4 weeks.  Results are promising but not conclusive.

  title: 'DrivingBeacon: Driving Behaviour Change Support System Considering Mobile
    Use and Geo-information'
- abstract: Summarization of doctor-patient conversations into clinical notes by medical
    scribes is an essential process for effective clinical care. Pre-trained transformer
    models have shown a great amount of success in this area, but the domain shift
    from standard NLP tasks to the medical domain continues to present challenges.
    We build upon several recent works to show that additional pre-training with in-domain
    medical conversations leads to performance gains for clinical summarization. In
    addition to conventional evaluation metrics, we also explore a clinical named
    entity recognition model for concept-based evaluation. Finally, we contrast long-sequence
    transformers with a common transformer model, BART. Overall, our findings corroborate
    research in non-medical domains and suggest that in-domain pre-training combined
    with transformers for long sequences are effective strategies for summarizing
    clinical encounters.

  title: In-Domain Pre-Training Improves Clinical Note Generation from Doctor-Patient
    Conversations
- abstract: 'Community question answering forums provide a convenient platform for
    people to source answers to their questions including those related to healthcare
    from the general public. The answers to user queries are generally long and contain
    multiple different perspectives, redundancy or irrelevant answers. This presents
    a novel challenge for domain-specific concise and correct multi-answer summarization
    which we propose in this paper. '

  title: Towards Development of an Automated Health Coach
- abstract: 'In this paper we present the main components of a weekly diet report
    generator (DRG) in natural language. The idea is to produce a text that contains
    information on the adherence  of the dishes eaten during a week to the Mediterranean
    diet. The system is based on a user model, a database of the dishes eaten during
    the week and on the automatic computation of the Mediterranean Diet Score. All
    these sources of information are exploited to produce a highly personalized text.

    The system has two main goals, related to two different kinds of users: on the
    one hand, when used by dietitians, the main goal is to highlight the most salient
    medical information of the patient diet and, on the other hand, when used by final
    users, the main goal is to educate them toward a Mediterranean style of eating.'
